# GlobalGameJam22
Game created for the Global Game Jam of 2022.



# Main Idea
You control a shepherd who happens to be a werewolf. You'll have to take care of your sheeps to keep them alive while protecting them from what you'll become at midnight.

# Gameplay
## Day
During the day, you'll have to take your sheeps to the place they need by making them run away from you or by picking them up and throwing them away. You should also place traps to protect your sheeps from what you'll become at midnight.

Your character can move, pick up sheeps, throw them away and place traps.

## Sleep
When it gets dark, you'll try to sleep. To keep you sleeping, a simple minigame similar to Google's dinosaur will display. In the moment you miss a jump, you'll wake up as a wolf.

You'll jump by tapping/clicking the screen.

## Night
As a wolf, you won't control your moves. You'll be just an spectator as your dark alter ego will try to eat the sheeps.


# Sheeps
Sheeps will have different needs:
  - Eat
  - Clean
  - Drink
  - Poo
  - Chill

They will run away from you when you get close. When they get to their place, they'll be there for some time and after that, they'll be chilling for a time before having a new need.
